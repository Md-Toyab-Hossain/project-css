    <h1>Manchester City F.C</h1>
    <p>City reach new heights as we win the Treble. A third consecutive Premier League title in May, followed by an FA Cup triumph in an all-Manchester final. And for the first time in the Club’s history, the team lifted the Champions League trophy after a 1-0 win over Inter. We followed that up with victory in the UEFA Super Cup, defeating Sevilla on penalties in Greece. But that’s wasn’t all for 2023 - in December we won the FIFA Club World Cup, ensuring our position as ‘The Best Team in the World and all the Land’.
